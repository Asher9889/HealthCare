    "Retrograde Intrarenal Surgery (RIRS) is a minimally invasive procedure for treating kidney stones.

            Retrograde Intrarenal Surgery (RIRS) is a modern, minimally invasive method used to treat kidney stones located in the renal pelvis, calyces, or complex areas. 
          </p>
          <p>
            During RIRS, a flexible ureteroscope is inserted through the urinary tract to visualize the kidney stones. Laser energy is then used to fragment and remove the stones without any external cuts.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is highly effective, especially for patients with stones that are difficult to reach using other methods, ensuring safe and precise removal.
