              An inguinal hernia happens when a part of the intestine or abdominal tissue pushes through a weak spot in the lower abdominal wall near the groin. It often appears as a visible bulge that becomes more prominent while coughing, lifting, or bending.

              This condition is more common in men but can also occur in women due to muscle weakness or pregnancy. Early diagnosis and surgery are important to prevent complications such as hernia strangulation.
