              There are three main types of gallstone surgeries commonly performed in India depending on the severity, number, and size of gallstones:

            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-3">
              <li>
                <strong>Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy (Keyhole Surgery):</strong> The most common and minimally invasive procedure for gallbladder removal. It involves small incisions through which a laparoscope and surgical tools are inserted to safely remove the gallbladder.
                <br />
                <span className="block mt-1">Benefits: Minimal pain and scarring, faster recovery (2–3 days), and same-day discharge.</span>
              </li>
  
              <li>
                <strong>Open Cholecystectomy:</strong> Recommended in complex or advanced cases where gallstones are large or the gallbladder is severely inflamed. The surgeon makes a larger abdominal incision to remove the gallbladder directly.
                <br />
                <span className="block mt-1">Benefits: Suitable for complicated cases, performed under full medical supervision.</span>
              </li>
  
              <li>
                <strong>Laser Surgery for Gallstones:</strong> An advanced and modern procedure that uses laser technology to remove the gallbladder or dissolve stones safely. It ensures minimal bleeding, no stitches, and rapid healing.
                <br />
                <span className="block mt-1">
